# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📘 Introduction
This repository explores **Requirement Analysis**, a foundational stage in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as the groundwork for understanding what a software system must do and ensuring that both technical and business goals are aligned.

---

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software application.

It is a critical phase in the SDLC because it lays the foundation for system design, development, and testing. Poor requirement analysis often results in project failure due to misalignment between user needs and system capabilities.

---

## 🔍 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Avoids Miscommunication:** Ensures that both technical teams and stakeholders share a common understanding of the system’s goals and expectations.
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces the need for extensive rework by identifying issues early in the process.
- **Improves Quality:** Clearly defined requirements lead to better-designed systems that meet user expectations.

---

## 🔧 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and research.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Actively engaging with users and stakeholders to extract detailed and accurate requirements.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Recording the requirements clearly in a standardized format such as SRS (Software Requirement Specification).
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing requirements for feasibility, clarity, and completeness; modeling helps in visualizing system behavior.
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring all documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are approved by stakeholders.

## 🗂️ Types of Requirements

### ✅ Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users should be able to search for available listings.
- Users can make and cancel bookings.
- Admins can add, update, or delete listings.

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system performs tasks.

**Examples:**
- The system should be able to handle 1,000 concurrent users.
- The booking confirmation email should be sent within 1 minute.
- The system should be responsive across devices.

## 🎯 Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve a goal.

### 💡 Benefits:
- Helps identify system functionalities.
- Makes communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders easier.
- Acts as a guide for writing detailed functional requirements.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are predefined requirements that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable by the client.

### 📝 Importance:
- Ensures that everyone is aligned on what "done" means.
- Reduces ambiguity.
- Serves as a foundation for test cases.

### 🔍 Example for Checkout Feature:
- User must be logged in to proceed to checkout.
- System must validate availability of listing before payment.
- Booking must not proceed without valid payment.
- A confirmation email must be sent immediately after successful booking.
